abstract = {Abstract This paper focuses on GARCH modelling of the nominal short-term interest rates of the Spanish government three-year bonds. This methodology allows an ex-ante approximation to this variable which proves to be a valuable alternative against econometric specifications that imply a homoscedastic error term. Then, real short-term interest rates are estimated by employing the reduced Fisher equation. Eventually, the results obtained are compared with the observed values of the real time-series in order to measure their accuracy.},

 abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

abstract = {We compare 330 ARCH-type models in terms of their ability to describe the conditional variance. The models are compared out-of-sample using DM– exchange rate data and IBM return data, where the latter is based on a new data set of realized variance. We find no evidence that a GARCH(1,1) is outperformed by more sophisticated models in our analysis of exchange rates, whereas the GARCH(1,1) is clearly inferior to models that can accommodate a leverage effect in our analysis of IBM returns. The models are compared with the test for superior predictive ability (SPA) and the reality check for data snooping (RC). Our empirical results show that the RC lacks power to an extent that makes it unable to distinguish ‘good’ and ‘bad’ models in our analysis. }

They are not linear but can often be estimated very simply with univariate or two step methods based on the likelihood function.

stochastic processes. To overcome this deficiency, we use EGARCH, IGARCH,
TGARCH, GJR-GARCH, NGARCH, AVGARCH and APARCH models for functional
relationships of the pathogen indicators time series for recreational activates at beaches.
We use generalized error, Student’s t, exponential, normal and normal inverse Gaussian
distributions along with their skewed versions to model pathogen indicator time series.
Generally speaking, turbidity, rainfall, dew point, river flow and cloud cover are
significant variables. EGARCH, TGARCH, NAGARCH and AVGARCH are not
radically different from each other in their output. However, TGARCH could be
marginally better than the rest of models in capturing response of the pathogen indicator
variable. Evidence supports some sign bias effect of the shocks. Dry weather and wet
weather conditions of the same magnitude seem to have disproportionate effect on
pathogens. Nyblom test shows that the estimated parameters are stable.},
